The customer [NordicNeuroLab][nnl] wanted a complete remake of their web site, which would be easy to update with news
articles and product details.

NordicNeuroLab's product catalog includes state of the art software and hardware products for the fMRI market, and for them
it was important that the web site reflected their company values, most importantly their focus on _innovation_ and _high quality_.

## Wordpress vs. Jekyll
I had heard so many good things about [Jekyll][jekyll], and so I managed to convince the customer to chose it as the
development platform. It didn't exactly make my case any worse, that they had som bad experience with Wordpress in the
past. Thus, I set out to learn Jekyll!

## Amazon S3
The nice thing about static sites is of course that they can be deployed almost anywhere. We chose Amazon S3 as our hosting
platform and used the _s3_website_ gem to push new releases.

The project was delivered on time (3 weeks).
