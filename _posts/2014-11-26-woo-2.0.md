Woo 2.0 was released on [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.woo_app.woo), and submitted to App Store today. 

In this version, we finally decided to scrap the questions part. Based on user feedback, we realised this feature was too complicated, and perhaps asking too much from the users. 

The new version still has tags, but there are no questions connected to them, and users can colour tags as they like or copy other people's tags to their own profile.
